# auto_keypress
requirement is pynput

This script basiacally presses a key repeateadly 

I've used to to skip videos without time line controlls

It can have other applications too feel free to download and use the code.

I am not responsible for any problem this script might create.
``` 
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
